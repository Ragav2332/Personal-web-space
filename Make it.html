        <p>Did you know that not long ago I went on a wonderful trip to Kodaikanal with my homies? Nah, you don't. 
            So we had this car (Maruti 800) called as 'Marvel' by it's owner Dev Abishek, along with four other bikes to ride.

         <p>We reached Palani via Dharapuram. Myself and Aravind didn't make a stop cause we were ahead of everyone.
            The homies behaved asif they were Brutus from Shakesphere's play and stopped for a tea break at Palani without calling us.
            There was this guy called odakkai in our gang who has painted his bike fluorescent green to attract chicks. 
            To our surprise, out of nowhere a girl asked him to take her for a ride.Bro used 'Fanny magnet' in real life.Let's take a look at the vehicles and the drivers.

        <p id="reach">Now that you know little about us, let's get back to the story. We rode for more than 4 hours and reached kodaikanal. 
            By the time we reached there, it was already past 4 in the evening. We checked-in to our room, dropped the luggage and went to 
            the lake situtated in the middle of the town. Some of them gone for a ride around the lake. Some of them chilled in the park nearby the lake.
